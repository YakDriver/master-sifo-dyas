# master-sifo-dyas

Random experiment with a dumb cipher (letter-for-letter swap). It seemed like it wouldn't be too hard to swap a few letters and have the encoded text be English also but not the same English as was input. It turns out this is not as easy as it might seem. This effort takes the [10,000 most common English words](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists/PG/2006/04/1-10000) (which I manually cleaned up a bit to remove stuff that wouldn't help the goal, such as 1-letter letters, except "a" and "I"), encodes them with random ciphers, and then counts English words in the encodings, giving more weight to more frequently-used words. It seems like it should work better than it does. I'll file this under "stuff that I thought would be easy and work fabulously but didn't so not being important moved on from."
